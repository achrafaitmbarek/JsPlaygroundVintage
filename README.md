# JsPlaygroundVintage

🚀 Welcome to the JavaScript Vintage Playground! 🕰️

This repository contains my old-school JavaScript practices, focusing on the basics and the inner workings of JavaScript.

## Contents

- `basics/`: Fundamentals of JavaScript.
- `how-it-works/`: A dive into the workings of JavaScript.
- `practice/`: Old coding exercises and experiments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/achrafaitmbarek/JsPlaygroundVintage.git`
2. Explore the folders and dive into the vintage JavaScript world!

Feeling bored one night, I impulsively pushed it—yes, that random JavaScript practice. Because, you know, coding is my kind of midnight thrill! 😄 Lol!

Feel free to tweak, experiment, or contribute to this timeless coding journey! 🎨

Happy Coding! 🚀
